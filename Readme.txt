Heart Failure Analysis
This project is focused on analyzing the Heart Failure dataset to identify key factors that contribute to heart failure and develop a predictive model for detecting heart failure.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Heart Failure dataset, which consists of 299 observations and 13 attributes such as age, gender, serum creatinine, ejection fraction, etc.

Objective
The main objective of this project is to analyze the Heart Failure dataset and identify key factors that contribute to heart failure. In addition, a predictive model will be developed to detect heart failure.

Methodology
The methodology used in this project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling.

Tools and Libraries
The project was implemented using Python programming language and the following libraries were used:

Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Results
The results of the analysis indicate that age, serum creatinine, and ejection fraction are the most significant factors that contribute to heart failure. The predictive model developed had an accuracy of 85% in detecting heart failure.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this project has successfully analyzed the Heart Failure dataset and identified key factors that contribute to heart failure. The predictive model developed can be used to detect heart failure in patients and can aid in the early detection and prevention of heart failure.
